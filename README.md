### Shallow Rendering
- basic component
- no children components

### Full Rendering
- need js dom since it involves dom

## Setup and Tear Down
- beforeEach() - put things you want to initially set up before your test executes
- afterEach() - put things in there that you want to clean up, like clean up the database
